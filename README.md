👋 Hi, I’m Fran!
I am a second-year Web Application Development student with a background in English Philology. I am passionate about data engineering and web development, with hands-on experience in Python basic exercises for cleaning and processing CSV and JSON datasets.  I also have foundational knowledge of Google Cloud Platform and am eager to apply cloud skills in practical projects. For now, I aim to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the fields of data engineering and web development, applying new skills to real-world projects and challenges.
